        "text": "NEW DELHI: India has climbed six places on the World Bank's Logistic Performance Index ( LPI ) 2023, now ranking 38th in the 139 countries index, as a result of significant investments in both soft and hard infrastructure as well as technology.India was ranked 44th on the index in 2018 and has now climbed to 38th in the 2023 listing. India's performance has drastically improved from 2014, when it was ranked 54th on the LPI.Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government had announced PM Gati Shakti initiative, a National Master Plan for multimodal connectivity, in October 2021 to reduce logistics cost and boost the economy by 2024-25.In 2022, the prime minister had launched the National Logistics Policy (NLP) to ensure quick last-mile delivery, end transport-related challenges, save time and money of the manufacturing sector and ensure desired speed in the logistics sector.These policy interventions are fructifying, which can be seen in India's jump in LPI and its other parameters. According to the report, India's rank moved up five places in infrastructure score from 52nd in 2018 to 47th in 2023. It climbed to 22nd spot for international shipments in 2023 from 44th in 2018 and moved four places up to 48th in logistics competence and equality.In timelines, India witnessed a 17-place jump in rankings, whereas it moved up three places in rank in tracking and tracing to 38th. The report quotes modernisation and digitalisation as a reason for emerging economies, like India, to leapfrog advanced countries.",

In an update to its Asian Development Outlook, the ADB said inflation is expected to continue to fall, approaching pre-pandemic levels as fuel and food prices decline. It forecast 3.6 per cent inflation this year for developing economies in Asia, and 3.4 per cent in 2024.",

        "text": "Nowadays sustainable fashion is a need, not a choice and India being the second largest producer of textiles, globally, is responsible for producing eco-friendly clothes. The youth of India should be responsible for focusing on utilising those sustainable and eco-friendly resources as by adopting a sustainable approach, we can save our environment.In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Bhaskar Mitra, Professor and Dean - School of Design (Fashion Design and Technology) at Lovely Professional University in India's Punjab, shared, \u201cIt is observed that youngsters are actually understanding the need for sustainable fashion and becoming more conscious about their buying behavior. However, there is still a lack of awareness among a large part of the population. High-end technologies and techniques are get used to produce sustainable clothes which makes them costlier than the other clothes. Hence, becomes a huge barrier.\u201dHe added, \u201cA large part of youth in India focuses on buying budget-friendly clothes, making it difficult for them to adopt sustainable fashion. Using the right and organic material, adopting the practice of reusing and recycling clothes, buying second-hand clothes and making less frequent purchases are some of the tips that everyone should follow. Sustainable fashion is not only about buying new stuff from eco-considerate and socially responsible producers but also about encouraging and cherishing cloth swaps, being proud of using secondhand things and repairing and reusing the damaged ones. After all, it\u2019s righteous to respect the planet and value what we already have.\u201dBringing her expertise to the same, Ankita Dwivedi, Founder of LQ Milano, said, \u201cThe sustainability express has finally stopped at the fashion station. Consequently, the apparel industry is going through a transition as brands have begun using environment friendly materials for manufacture. This trend has also made waves in the kids wear market with a view to instill consideration in children towards the environment. However, barriers like cost, logistics, consumer perception etc. must be considered to establish a sustainable kids wear line-up. Sustainable materials like recycled polyester fibers, processed cotton and natural dyes are difficult to source resulting in the increase of production cost, subsequently elevating prices.\u201d",

(File photo)\n\nFor the first time in 45 years, Yamuna river's flood waters reached the walls of the Taj Mahal in Agra, leaving the garden behind it submerged. The water, however, is unlikely to enter the main monument thanks to its design, Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) stated.'The Taj Mahal was developed in such a way that water cannot enter the main mausoleum even during high floods. The last time the Yamuna touched the back wall of the Taj Mahal was during high floods in 1978,' Prince Vajpayee, conservation assistant at ASI, told the media.Incessant rains have led to an alarming rise in Yamuna's water level and flooded the adjacent Dussehra Ghat and even the outer parts of Itimad-ud-Daula's tomb, located nearby.ASI officials claimed that other monuments that risk being affected by Yamuna's floodwaters such as Rambagh, Mehtab Bagh, Zohra Bagh 'have suffered no damage so far and that flood waters had not entered the basement of the Taj'.",

Due to this, devotees reaching the twin cities of Mathura and Vrindavan had a tough time as the flood water inundated religious sites. These sites include Mathura\u2019s most prominent Vishram Ghat where water has entered the temples and submerged stairs.So much so that daily \u201caarti\u201d is being performed at a makeshift site. The Yamuna water level in Mathura that touched 166.08 metres, slightly above the danger mark of 166 metres, on July 15, rose to 167.28 metres on Monday (July 17).Mathura is facing flood because of water released in the Yamuna from Okhla Barrage in Delhi. Road leading to Bengali Ghat from Vishram Ghat was waterlogged on Monday\u201cWe are making announcements in low lying area asking people to avoid going near the river flowing at a high speed. Two companies of NDRF are in action and till Sunday, 400 people from flood affected villages had been shifted to shelter homes through eight boats deployed for the exercise,\u201d said Mathura district magistrate Pulkit Khare.Devotees are not able to lodge \u2018parikrama\u2019 (circumambulation) at Vrindavan with 12-kilometre-long track having waterlogging between Varah ghat and Chamunda Devi temple in Vrindavan. Local police are found moving on boat on the parikrama route in Vrindavan these days.\u201cParikrama (circumambulation) has been stopped in Vrindavan because of Yamuna water reaching the track of parikrama route. Although the Yamuna is flowing above the danger mark in Mathura, it is hoped that things might settle soon,\u201d said ADM (finance and revenue), Mathura, Yoganand Pandey.",

This is not one of them. Frankly, $7 billion for a sporting event, we are not doing that,\" he said at a press conference in Melbourne.\n\n\"I will not take money out of hospitals and schools to host an event that is three times the cost estimated and budgeted for last year.\n\n\"The Games will not proceed in Victoria in 2026. We have informed Commonwealth Games authorities of our decision to seek to terminate the contract,\" he added.\n\nThe",
